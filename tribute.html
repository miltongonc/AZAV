        Ali grew up in racial segregation and showed that he wasn't afraid of
        anything at quite an early age. He was often denied from food at a
        grocery store due to his skin color. At 15, Ali discovered his talent
        for boxing, when his bicycle got stolen and he told the police that he'd
        beat up the thief. <br />

        Seeing his confidence, the officer who was also a boxing trainer took
        him under his wing. Ali started training hard day and night and soons
        began his boxing career. he hated every minute of training, but said to
        himself :
        <strong
          >" Don't quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion
          ".</strong
        >
        <br />

        Ali knew that he'd be the greatest, even before he was. Soon, he became
        the World heavyweight champion in 1964. But then, he lost 3 prime years
        of his career, when he refused to serve in Vietnam war and got stripped
        of his boxing licence. <br />

        In 1970, he made an amazing comeback. He returned to the ring with a
        fantastic win proving the world, that he is still unbeatable. Ali
        devoted much of his time in humanitarian causes, after being diagnosed
        with Parkinson's disease. His illness kept on getting worse and the
        world experienced a huge loss, when he passed away in 2016. Muhammad Ali
        is known as the greatest boxer of all time. <br />
